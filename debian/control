Description: enhanced multi-threaded syslogd
 Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd supporting, amongst others:
  * reliable syslog over TCP and RFC 3195
  * writing to MySQL databases
  * permitted sender lists
  * filtering on any part of the syslog message
  * on-the-wire message compression
  * fine grained output format control
  * backup log destinations
 .
 It is quite compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in
 replacement. Its advanced features make it suitable for enterprise-class,
 encryption protected syslog relay chains while at the same time being very
 easy to setup for the novice user.
