<h2>troubleshooting rsyslog</h2>
<p><b>Having trouble with <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com">rsyslog</a>?</b>
This page provides some tips on where to look for help and what to do
if you need to ask for assistance. This page is continously being expanded.
<p>Useful troublehshooting ressources are:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc">rsyslog documentation</a> - note that the online version always covers
the most recent development version. However, there is a version-specific
doc set in each tarball. If you installed rsyslog from a package, there usually
is a rsyslog-doc package, that often needs to be installed separately.
<li>The <a href="http://wiki.rsyslog.com">rsyslog wiki</a> provides user tips and experiences.
</ul>
<p><b>Asking for Help</b>
<p>If you can't find the answer yourself, you should look at these places for
community help.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://kb.monitorware.com/rsyslog-f40.html">rsyslog forum</a>. This is
the preferred method of obtaining support.
<li>The <a href="http://lists.adiscon.net/mailman/listinfo/rsyslog">rsyslog mailing list</a>.
This is a low-volume list which occasional gets traffic spikes.
The mailing list is probably a good place for complex questions.
