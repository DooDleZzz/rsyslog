<h1>RSyslog - History</h1>

<b>Rsyslog is a GPL-ed, enhanced syslogd. Among others, it offers support for 
reliable syslog over TCP, writing to
MySQL databases and fully configurable output formats (including great timestamps).</b>
Rsyslog was initiated by <a href="http://www.gerhards.net/rainer">Rainer Gerhards</a>. 
If you are interested to learn why&nbsp; Rainer initiated&nbsp; the project, you 
may want to read his blog posting on &quot;<a href="http://rgerhards.blogspot.com/2007/08/why-does-world-need-another-syslogd.html">why 
the world neeeds another syslogd</a>&quot;.<p>Rsyslog has
been forked in <b>2004</b> from the <a href="http://www.infodrom.org/projects/sysklogd/">sysklogd standard package</a>.
The goal of the
rsyslog project is to provide a feature-richer and reliable
syslog deamon while retaining drop-in replacement capabilities to stock syslogd. By "reliable", we mean support for reliable transmission
modes like TCP or <a href="http://www.monitorware.com/Common/en/glossary/rfc3195.php">RFC 3195</a> 
(syslog-reliable). We do NOT imply that the sysklogd package is unreliable.</p>
<p>The name "rsyslog" stems back to the
planned support for syslog-reliable. Ironically, the initial release
of rsyslog did NEITHER support syslog-reliable NOR tcp based syslog.
Instead, it contained enhanced configurability and other enhancements
(like database support). The reason for this is that full support for RFC 3195 would require even more changes and especially fundamental architectural
changes. Also, questions asked on the loganalysis list and at other
places indicated that RFC3195 is NOT a prime priority for users, but
rather better control over the output format. So there we were, with
a rsyslod that covers a lot of enhancements, but not a single one
of these that made its name ;) Since version 0.9.2, receiving syslog messages 
via plain tcp is finally supported, a bit later sending via TCP, too. Starting 
with 1.11.0, RFC 3195 is finally support at the receiving side (a.k.a. &quot;listener&quot;). 
Support for sending via RFC 3195 is still due. Anyhow, rsyslog has come much 
closer to what it name promises.</p>
<p>
The database support was initially included so that our web-based syslog 
interface could be used. This is another open source project which can be found
under <a href="http://www.phplogcon.org">http://www.phplogcon.org</a>. We highly recommend having a look at 
it. It might not work for you if you expect thousands of messages per
second (because your database won't be able to provide adequate performance),
but in many cases it is a very handy analysis and troubleshooting tool.

In the mean time, of course, lots of people have found many applications for 
writing to databases, so the prime focus is no longer on phpLogcon.

</p>
<p>Rsyslogd supports an enhanced syslog.conf file format, and also works
with the standard syslog.conf. In theory, it should be possible to simply replace
the syslogd binary with the one that comes with rsyslog. Of course, in order
to use any of the new features, you must re-write your syslog.conf. To learn
how to do this, please review our commented <a href="sample.conf.php">sample.conf</a>
file. It outlines the enhancements over stock syslogd. Discussion has often 
arisen of whether having an &quot;old syslogd&quot; logfile format is good or evil. So 
far, this has not been solved (but Rainer likes the idea of a new format), so we 
need to live with it for the time being. It is planned to be reconsidered in the 
3.x release time frame.
<p>If you are interested in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHE">IHE</a> 
environment, you might be interested to hear that rsyslog supports message with 
sizes of 32k and more. This feature has been tested, but by default is turned off 
(as it has some memory footprint that we didn't want to put on users not 
actually requiring it). Search the file syslogd.c and search for &quot;IHE&quot; - you 
will find easy and precise instructions on what you need to change (it's just 
one line of code!). Please note that RFC 3195/COOKED supports 1K message sizes 
only. It'll probably support longer messages in the future, but it is our 
believe that using larger messages with current RFC 3195 is a violation of the 
standard.<p>In <b>February 2007</b>, 1.13.1 was released and served for quite a 
while as a stable reference. Unfortunately, it was not later released as stable, 
so the stable build became quite outdated.<p>In <b>June 2007</b>, Peter Vrabec from Red Hat helped us to create 
RPM files for Fedora as well as supporting IPv6. There also seemed to be some 
interest from the Red Hat community. This interest and new ideas resulted in a 
very busy time with many great additions.<p>In <b>July 2007</b>, Andrew 
Pantyukhin added BSD ports files for rsyslog and liblogging. We were strongly 
encouraged by this too. It looks like rsyslog is getting more and more momentum. 
Let's see what comes next...<p>Also in <b>July 2007</b> (and beginning of 
August), Rainer remodled the output part of rsyslog. It got a clean object model 
and is now prepared for a plug-in architecture. During that time, some base 
ideas for the overall new object model appeared.<p>In <b>August 2007</b> 
community involvment grew more and more. Also, more packages appeared. We were 
quite happy about that. To facilitate user contributíons, we set up a
<a href="http://wiki.rsyslog.com/">wiki</a> on August 10th, 2007. Also in August 
2007, rsyslog 1.18.2 appeared, which is deemed to be quite close to the final 
2.0.0 release. With its appearance, the pace of changes was deliberatly reduced, 
in order to allow it to mature (see Rainers's
