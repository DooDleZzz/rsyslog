<h1>rsyslog bugs and annoyances</h1>
<p><b>This page lists the known bugs rsyslog has to offer.</b> Please note that 
we also have a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=696552&group_id=123448&func=browse">
bug tracker at sourceforge.net</a>. This list here contains more architectural 
things while the bug tracker most often lists things that you will actually 
experience. Please be sure to visit the bug tracker in addition to this list 
here.</p>

<h1>rsyslogd</h1>
<h2>stability in multithreaded mode</h2>
<p>We have some reports that rsyslogd, if compiled with multi-threading enabled, 
segfaults in some environments. We are actively looking at fixing this issue, 
but as it does not occur in our lab environment, that unfortunately takes some 
time. If you experience a segfault, please report it. As a work-around, you can 
compile rsyslog without multi-threading:</p>
<p>./configure --disable-pthreads<br>
make clean<br>
make<br>
make install</p>
<p>This somewhat reduces the ability to handle large message bursts, but even in 
single-threaded mode rsyslogd offers great performance (just think that stock 
sysklogd has always been using a single thread, only).</p>
<h2>forwarding remotely received messages</h2>
<p>Sysklogd does not forward remotely received messages to other network 
destination except when the -h option is given. This code is currently defunct. 
No matter if -h is specified or not, messages are ALWAYS forwarded. It is 
currently under review if the sysklogd's functionality is actually needed. 
Please see my
<a href="http://rgerhards.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-syslogd-h-option.html">blog 
post on this topic</a> for further detail.</p>
<h2>EQUALLY-NAMED TEMPLATES</h2>
<p>If multiple templates with the SAME name are created, all but the
   first definition is IGNORED. So you can NOT (yet) replace a
   template definition. I also strongly doubt I will ever support this, because 
it does not make an awful lot of sense (after all, why not use two template 
names...).</p>
<h2>WALLMSG FORMAT (* selector)
   </h2>
<p>This format is actually not 100% compatible with stock syslogd - the
   date is missing. Will be fixed soon and can also be fixed just via
   the proper template. Anyone up for this? ;)</p>
<h2>SIGPIPE HANDLING</h2>
<p>Currently, SIGPIPE is ignored. This is necessary to handle broken TCP
  connections. We should further look into this issue and see which other
  ways exist to handle the situation.</p>
<h2>MULTIPLE INSTANCES</h2>
<p>If multiple instances are running on a single machine, the one with
  the -r switch must start first. Also, UDP-based syslog forwarding between the 
instances does not work. Use TCP instead.</p>
